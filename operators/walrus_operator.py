# Since python 3.8, the walrus operator ( := ) gives a new syntax for assigning variables in the middle of expressions.
# A traditional assignment doesn't return the value, an assignment expression, with :=, it does.
#
# Walrus operator use cases
# * Repeated function calls can make your code slower than necessary.
# * Repeated statements can make your code hard to maintain.
# * Repeated calls that exhaust iterators can make your code overly complex.
