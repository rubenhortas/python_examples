You are given a list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown number of times.
Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original **sorted list** was rotated to obtain the given list.
Your function should have the worst-case complexity of **O(log(N))**.
You can assume that **all the numbers in the list are unique**.

Example: The list [5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4] was obtained by rotating the sorted list [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] three times.
